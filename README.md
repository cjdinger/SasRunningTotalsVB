# SAS custom task example: Calculate Running Totals (Visual Basic version)
***
This repository contains one of a series of examples that accompany
_Custom Tasks for SAS Enterprise Guide using Microsoft .NET_ 
by [Chris Hemedinger](http://support.sas.com/hemedinger).

This particular example goes with
**Chapter 11:  Calculating Running Totals**.  It was built using Visual Basic
with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.  It should run in SAS Enterprise Guide 4.3 and later.

## About this example
This task adapts a simple SAS program and places an intuitive user 
interface on top of it.  The user interface incorporates 
some of the familiar elements from the tasks that are built into 
SAS Enterprise Guide, including the variable selector and the 
output data selector.  These consistent 
elements help to ensure that the end users of the task will have no 
trouble learning how to use it.

This chapter describes most of the main considerations for building this task, 
but does not provide a complete step-by-step tutorial.  Use the provided source code 
as a reference, and use the content in this chapter to provide 
additional context and explanation for how the task is put together.
